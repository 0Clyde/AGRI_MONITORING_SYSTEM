                <h3>What is Agri Monitoring System?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Agri Monitoring System is a digital solution that provides farmers with tools to track and monitor key data on crops, livestock, and fisheries. The system enables the handler to keep track of the data, progress, and production of agricultural goods in real-time, helping to ensure better decision-making and higher productivity.
